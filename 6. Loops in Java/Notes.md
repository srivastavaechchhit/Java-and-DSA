# Iterative Statements or Loops

The sentence, or block of codes (here) that is used to perform a specific task a given number of times can be called as **iterative statements** or **loops.**

# Types of loop
In Java, we have **three** types of loops:-

## While Loop

```ruby
while (condition) {
        //code
}
```

## For Loop

```ruby
for (init statement; conditon; final-expression) {
        // code
}
```
- All the three expressions in the for-loop are optional but not the semicolon.

## Do-while Loop

```ruby
do {
        // code
} while (condition);
```
- The First iteration is always executed, without even checking the condition provided to terminate the loop.


### Break Keyword
- 'break' is a keyword in Java that is used to terminate the program. As soon as the execution of code reaches 'break', the program will take an exit immediately.

### Continue Keyword
- 'continue' is a keyword in Java that is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next one without terminating the program.
