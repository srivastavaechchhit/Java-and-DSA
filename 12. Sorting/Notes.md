# Sorting
To arrange something in any order provided according to the condition.

---

## Stable and Unstable Sort
- **Stable sort:** Order of appearance of duplicate elements is same in the sorted array as given in the original array
- **Unstable sort:** Order of appearance of duplicate elements gets changed in the sorted array as given in the original array

---

## Types of Sorting algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

---

### Bubble Sort
- We do a certain number of passes and in each pass, we compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are not in correct order.
- In every iteration, the largest number in part of array to be processed gets its correct position.
- Bubble sort is a stable algorithm.

---

### Selection Sort
- We select an element and put it at its correct place
- Selection sort is an unstable algorithm.

---

### Insertion Sort
- We divide the given array into two parts - Sorted and Unsorted
- Take one element, iterate through the sorted part and find the correct position of the element.
- Insertion sort is a stable algorithm.
